# dotfiles

A collection of linux/mac dotfiles, the .osx file was a fork from 
geerlinguy/dotfiles for the purposes of the mac-dev-playbook Ansible 
playbook but has been personalized with some of my standard 
customizations.

The zsh files are the ones I am maintaining at the moment, but I try
to back-port as much as I can into the bash dotfiles to keep
them in sync.

Standard usage is to checkout the repo into a local dir and then
symlink to the actual dotfiles in the homedir.
