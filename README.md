# dotfiles

A collection of mac dotfiles, the .osx file was a fork from geerlinguy/dotfiles for 
the purposes of the mac-dev-playbook Ansible playbook but has been personalized with
some of my standard customizations. At the moment the .zshrc is mostly a simple copy
of geerlingguy/dotfiles version until I start doing some zsh tweaking.
